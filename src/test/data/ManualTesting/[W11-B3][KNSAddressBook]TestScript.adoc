[NOTE]

. Click any contact found in the `PersonList`.
. In the `PersonPanel`, click on the currently displayed avatar of the contact. You should see a new window called "_Avatar Options_".
. Clicking on `Save` will give you the error message `Avatar should be a valid online URL or local path`, as you have not loaded any image.
. Click `Load`. You should see a new window prompting you to open a new image.
. Select the image you intend to use and press `Open`.
[NOTE]
There should be an option in the window to choose between `.JPG` or `.PNG` formats.
. You should now see the new image displayed in the "_Avatar Options_" window.
. Click `Save`. You should see the reflected changes in the command box and `PersonPanel`.
