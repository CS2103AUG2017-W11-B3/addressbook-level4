By: `Team W11-B3`      Since: `Sep 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Hello there! If you came here by choice, then chances are that you are interested in how we have further adapted from
the original source code (https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook-Level4 project])
provided by the https://github.com/se-edu[SE-EDU initiative]. This developer guide provides information that will help
you understand what features we have implemented, and how we have done so.

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

Before you get stared, do ensure that you have the following installed on your computer:

* *Java SE Development Kit (JDK) `1.8.0_60`* or later
You can download Java SE Development Kit link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here].
+
[NOTE]
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8 (_anything before `1.8.0_60`_).
+

* *IntelliJ* Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
You can download IntelliJ IDE link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here].
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed; do not disable them! If you have disabled them, go to
`File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

Once you have installed everything required, you can continue on with the next part.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B3/main[this] repository to your GitHub account, and clone the fork to your
computer.
. Open IntelliJ (_if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
dialog first_)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command
.. `gradlew processResources` (_on Windows_)
.. `./gradlew processResources` (_on Mac OS X/Linux_)
+
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests. You should see a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a entering few commands in the application.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding
standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To
rectify this,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (_Windows/Linux_), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (_Mac OS X_)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent
IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`,
`import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check
style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

Set up Travis to perform CI for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (_see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>_).

[TIP]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (_Travis
is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based_).

==== Before coding


Before you start coding, do read the link:#architecture[Architecture] section below so that you can get a clearer sense of
the overall design of the application. This will help you understand how the application works, and how your changes
can affect the entire system.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

Lastly, if you plan to develop this as a separate product (_i.e. instead of contributing to the
`CS2103AUG2017-W11-B3/main`)_, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and
`UserGuide.adoc` with your fork's URL, and make changes to the documentation where necessary.

== Design

=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* below explains the high-level design of the application:

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

==== `Main` Component

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible
for,

* *At application launch*: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* *At shut down*: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

==== `Commons` Component

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those
classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (_written using
https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]_) is used by components to
communicate with other components using events (_i.e. a form of Event Driven design_)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by most classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

==== The Other 4 Components

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The user interface (_UI_) of the application.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

=== Events-Driven nature of the design

==== Components Interaction

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command
`delete 1`:

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1.1 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
`Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage`
to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved
to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1.2 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be
coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between
components.

=== UI Component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand`
and `Command` in Figure 3.4.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

*  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
*  The command execution can affect the `Model` (_e.g. adding a person_) and/or raise events.
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
API call:

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.0c : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage Component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams]
folder. To update a diagram, just modify the objects inside `.pptx` file to your liking, and then `Save as picture`.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing
and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (_e.g. `add`, `edit`_). Such commands will inherit
from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead.
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Inheritance diagram for Undo/Redo command_

`UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone,
such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such
as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those
extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this
technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child
classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state
of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the
`undoStack`. The current state is saved together with the command as shown:

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may
execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person like so:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the
address book to the state before the `add` command executed as shown:

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when
popping the `undoStack`.

=== Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1_

The redo does the exact opposite: pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state
after the command is executed.

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when
popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This
time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command
(this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.2_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command`
rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.3_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.2.4_

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal
with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to
undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (_e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted_). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (_the view can easily be re-modified as no data is
lost_). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (_undoing filtering for example_), only to
realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and
not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion
https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo. +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new
incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different
things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::personpanel[]
=== Person Panel

The PersonPanel replaces the previous BrowserPanel, and is a crucial part of MainWindow.

==== Java Implementation

By taking advantage of the java.util.logging package, PersonPanel is able to display all of the details of a contact
(_name, address, email, contact number, birthday, tags_) selected in PersonCard. This implementation can be seen from
the following 2 code snippets:

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    loadPersonPage(event.getNewSelection().person);
}
----

**Code Snippet 1 (handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()):** Whenever a contact is selected, an event will be
triggered. The method will respond to the event by obtaining a ReadOnlyPerson variable (_which contains all the details
of the contact_), and pass it into loadPersonPage().

[source,java]
----
private void loadPersonPage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    name.setText(person.getName().fullName);
    phone.setText("Phone: " + person.getPhone().toString());
    address.setText("Address: " + person.getAddress().toString());
	email.setText("Email: " + person.getEmail().toString());
	birthday.setText("Birthday: " + person.getBirthday().toString());
	tags.getChildren().clear();
	person.getTags().forEach(tag -> {
		Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
		tagLabel.setStyle("-fx-background-color: " + tag.tagColour);
		tags.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
	});
}
----

**Code Snippet 2 (loadPersonPage()):** The ReadOnlyPerson variable passed into loadPersonPage can then be used to
extract the contact's details for display; the UI will be updated accordingly to reflect these changes.

[NOTE]
Upon opening the application, no contact details will be displayed since no contact has been selected yet.

==== Layout Implementation

The layout for PersonPanel is specified in PersonPanel.fxml. Visually, it can be broken down into 2 parts as shown:

image::PersonPanelLayout.png[width="760"]
_Figure 4.4.2.1: Visual breakdown of PersonPanel_

**Part 1 (primaryDetails):** This is subdivided into parts A and B. Part A contains the avatar picture of the contact.
At the moment, there is a placeholder image. In the future, we will implement support for custom avatars.
Part B contains the Name and Tags of the contact, which we found to be important in recognising a displayed contact
quickly. Hence, they are in a larger font in order to stand out.

**Part 2 (secondaryDetails):** This displays the Address, Email, Contact Number and Birthday of the contact. As these
details are less important than the Name and Tags, they are placed below and are in a smaller font. At the moment, this
section appears simple but empty. We plan to implement more features, such as a "Notes about Contact" and
"Birthday Countdown".

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Display of Contact's Details. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace BrowserPanel with PersonPanel, which displays all of the contacts details.
Remove all details but Name and Tags from PersonCard.  +
**Pros:** We can build upon PersonPanel and add more features to it, that the BrowserPanel could not achieve.  +
**Cons:** PersonPanel will not be able to display personal web pages (_e.g. Contact's Social Media page_). +
**Alternative 2:** Keep BrowserPanel and use HTML files to display contact details instead. +
**Pros:** No need to modify existing code; instead just figure out a way to edit and display HTML files that show the
contact's details. +
**Cons:** May take too long to implement since we are not familiar with how we can do so.

---

**Aspect:** Display of Tags In PersonPanel (_and PersonCard_). +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Randomly colourise tags to make them distinct. +
**Pros:** Quick to implement and makes it easier for user to differentiate between tags. +
**Cons:** Tags are always changing colour for each new instance of the application; may seem confusing. +
**Alternative 2:** Keep the previous blue colour for all tags. +
**Pros:** Consistent and simple; no work is needed to be done. +
**Cons:** Takes users a longer time to differentiate between tags.

---

**Aspect:** Addition of Icons for secondaryDetails. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Place icons on the left of each contact detail. +
**Pros:** Quick to implement and makes it easier for user to differentiate between each contact detail. Icons can be
easily taken from Google's Material.io website. +
**Cons:** N/A +
**Alternative 2:** Use different colours for each contact detail. +
**Pros:** Even more quick to implement since it only involves CSS changes. +
**Cons:** Bad idea design-wise because it violates the Triadic Colour Scheme. It could make the application look less
professional and unattractive.
// end::personpanel[]

//tag::partialfind[]
=== Partial Find
The partial matching of the Find command is implemented by creating a method in the `StringUtil` class with the help of
the `regionMatches` method from the java `String` class.
It replaces the method for matching in all predicate classes that is used by the command.

[NOTE]

The Find command now only use partial matching and has lost the full matching functionality


Previously, the method used for matching was implemented as such :
[source, java]
----
public static boolean containsWordIgnoreCase(String sentence, String word) {
        // ...check and prepare arguments..
        for (String wordInSentence: wordsInPreppedSentence) {
            if (wordInSentence.equalsIgnoreCase(preppedWord)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
----

By using the `equalsIgnoreCase` method, the query word has to exactly match, ignoring case, the sentence word for the
method to return `true`. +



Now, we introduce a slightly modified version to allow for partial matching as such :
[source, java]
----
 public static boolean containsWordPartialIgnoreCase(String sentence, String word) {
        //..check and prepare arguments..
        for (String wordInSentence: wordsInPreppedSentence) {
            if (wordInSentence.toLowerCase().contains(preppedWord.toLowerCase())) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
----

By using the `contains` method, we now allow the query word to be a substring of the sentence word.


We then replace the use of the previous method in the Predicate classes in model
(_e.g. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`_) with the new method so that the Find command actually uses partial matching.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Exclusive use of partial matching. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find command exclusively uses partial matching. +
**Pros:** Simple implementation, doesn't affect complexity from user's perspective and easier for users to utilize Find
command. +
**Cons:** Users lose the ability to do full matching when it would be useful
(_e.g. a lot of people with similiar names_). +
**Alternative 2:** Give the option to toggle/use either partial matching or full matching +
**Pros:** More flexible and powerful. +
**Cons:** Requires more complicated syntax which can be confusing to new users, most use cases are already covered by
partial matching.


---

**Aspect:** Type of partial matching +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches can be from anywhere in the word +
**Pros:** Restricts the scope of search which increases relevancy but still giving enough flexibility for users. +
**Cons:** Can be unintuitive, less powerful. +
**Alternative 2:** Matches are required to be from the start of each word. +
**Pros:** Restricts the scope of search which increases relevancy but still giving enough flexibility for users. +
**Cons:** Can be unintuitive, less powerful. +

// end::partialfind[]

// tag::addtagcommand[]
=== Add Tag

The add tag command is facilitated by the AddTagCommand, which is useful for adding a tag to a person inside the
address book.

==== Java Implementation

AddTagCommand is a command. As AddTagCommand modifies the state of the address book (_adding a tag to a contact in the
address book_), AddTagCommand inherits UndoableCommands. Therefore, users can undo/redo their previously
entered AddTagCommand.

AddTagCommand is implemented in this way:

[source,java]
----
public class AddTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

AddTagCommand can be used by calling the method with an index and a string of tag name that will be added, shown by
this code snippet:

[source,java]
----
public AddTagCommand(Index index, Set<Tag> addedTag) {
    requireNonNull(index);
    requireNonNull(addedTag);

    this.index = index;
    this.addedTag = addedTag;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of AddTagCommand +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implementing a new command AddTagCommand instead of using the existing
Edit command.  +
**Pros:** Users can add a single tag only by typing the new tag that they want to assign to a contact.  +
**Cons:** Currently AddTagCommand could only add a single new tag every time it is executed (_future enhancement
will enable AddTagCommand to add more than 1 tag when executed_). +
**Alternative 2:** Use existing Edit command to add a single tag to a person in the address book. +
**Pros:** Less command to remember. +
**Cons:** Users need to type all existing tags added by the new tag when they are using Edit command. There is a
possibility of some error that can be avoided when using AddTagCommand, such as mistyping the existing tags or not
adding a complete set of existing tags.

// end::addtagcommand[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and
logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
(_See link:#configuration[Configuration]_).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the
specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of
just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(_default:_ `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility
in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview
the end result of your edits. Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to
preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as
Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files
in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` ->
`Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results,
use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to
platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (_Mac/Linux:_ `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests`
(_Mac/Linux:_ `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the
`systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (_those code units are assumed to be
working_). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected
together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on
our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file
you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated
using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than
these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (_this bloats the repo size_) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (_this creates extra work for developers_)
