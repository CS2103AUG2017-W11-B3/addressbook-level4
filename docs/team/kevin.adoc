=== Enhancement Proposed: Boolean Searching

==== Justification

Given the target audience of our product, it is plausible that they would need to find people who matches certain
criteria without having a specific person in mind. For example, they might need to find everyone who are clients but not
currently overseas. In current form, there is no way for them to do this easily. +
Boolean searching will allow them to search using AND and NOT keywords to enable a much easier searching experience.
